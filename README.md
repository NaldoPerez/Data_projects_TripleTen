## Project 1: Sprint 4 - Superstore Analysis
The project focuses on analyzing key aspects of profitability, advertising effectiveness, and product returns to help a struggling superstore avoid bankruptcy. For profitability, I identified the top two profit centers and loss-makers across different dimensions, recommending which products and subcategories to focus on or stop selling. For advertising, I analyzed state-month combinations to determine where and when the store should advertise, justifying the cost based on the return on ad spend. Lastly, I examined product returns, identifying items and customers with the highest return rates and analyzed how returns impact profits across various dimensions.

## Project 2: Sprint 5 - 'What is causing returns?'
The project focuses on analyzing return rates to identify the root causes of product returns and build a dashboard to monitor these trends. I created worksheets to explore correlations between sales and returns, analyzed return rates across categories, customers, geography, and time, and developed composite charts to capture multi-factor insights. The next phase involved designing a dashboard mock-up, refining it, and adding interactive elements. Lastly, I prepared a presentation summarizing the analysis, interpreting the dashboard results, and proposing next steps for reducing returns and implementing the dashboard in operations.

## Project 3: Another Analysis
For this project, I was tasked with analyzing the Manhattan vacation rental market using Airbnb data to guide a client on property investment. I focused on identifying the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes by analyzing rental frequency (measured by reviews), and I generated insights through pivot tables and charts. The analysis included cleaning the data, ranking neighborhoods by attractiveness, and creating visualizations to showcase the most popular areas and property sizes for vacation rentals.

## Project 4: Another Analysis
For my onboarding assignment at Zomato, I was tasked with analyzing test datasets to assess the business performance of restaurants and customers. I focused on one of three areas—customer segmentation, restaurant popularity, or sales dynamics—and built a Tableau dashboard and story to present key findings and insights in a report or presentation format.
